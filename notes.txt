Steps:
-1 Rebuild it with gatsby
	local xml data

0 Improve UX
	Buttons always visible
	Remove the label that repeats the color

	0.1 Replace Building / Sleeping / Checking for modifications with gifs / nice svgs

	0.2 Have a detailed tooltip displayed, that comes from the config (at least for now, ideally it would come from jenkins / ccnet)

	0.3 Add a button to pop a modal window, to describe how the dashboard works / shows the mapping between colors and statuses

1 Have a list of mappings between project name and "row" and "column". row 0 is the top one, 1 is the one below it.
	Display accordingly
	Have a checkConfig function to check that the assumptions about the layout are correct (no gaps both vertically and horizontally?)

	1.1 Center it

2 Add a third button to link to the docs. The link comes from the config

3 Add a "Looks flakey" icon on build failure by retrieving the history of the failling tests (It's flaky if all failling test failed X number of times in the last X days)
	Testers can then trigger the build when it looks flakey
------------------------

Is this applicable / helping:
- Have a "Direction" property and display an arrow inside the block that can point down, up, convergent (-> <-), divergent (<- ->)
Have a look and see hard it is to make it a generic dashboard (how do Jenkins' wall display work for exemple)
	A middleware responsible for the mapping of the fields, configurable urls, JSON polling support and more.
